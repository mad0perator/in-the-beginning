    "text": "Background\n\nThe Language\nHebrew is an ancient Semitic language that has been spoken for over 3,000 years. It was originally written using a script known as Paleo-Hebrew1 which consisted of 22 letters and was used until around the 5th century BC. Hebrew was primarily a spoken language Israelites used to communicate to one another.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  sem(Semitic)\n  sem --- arb(Arabic)\n  sem --- arc(Aramaic)\n  sem --- heb(Hebrew)\n  %% Arabic\n  arb --- eth(Ethiopic)\n  arb --- amh(Amharic)\n  %% Aramaic\n  arc --- syr(Syriac)\n  arc --- man(Mandaic)\n  arc --- chl(Chaldaic)\n  %% Hebrew\n  heb --- phx(Phoenician)\n  heb --- can(Canaanite)\n\n\nFigure 1: The Semitic Language Family\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Timeline\n\n\n\n\n\ntimeline\n  title Brief History of Hebrew Writing\n  1000 BC : The Merneptah Stele - earliest known inscription written in Hebrew.\n  500 BC : The Paleo-Hebrew script is used in the writing of the Torah and other religious texts.\n  200 AD : Aramaic becomes the dominant language of the region and Hebrew usage declines.\n  1000 AD : Hebrew is still used as a liturgical language but is no longer spoken as a native language.\n  1700s AD : The Hebrew revival movement begins, led by figures such as Moses Mendelssohn and Eliezer Ben Yehuda.\n\n\nFigure 2: Brief Timeline of Hebrew Writing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Alphabet\n\nAleph-Beyt\n\n\nThe Letters\nThe Paleo-Hebrew script was a phonetic abjad2 used by the ancient Israelites before the adoption of the modern Hebrew (Square) script. It consists of 22 letters, all of which are consonants3. Like modern Hebrew, it is written from right to left. Influenced by Egyptian culture before the Exodus from enslavement, features from the hieroglyphs such as the use of the acrophonic4 principle as well as resemblance in some of the forms5 are readily apparent. These letters are the basis for almost every written alphabet in use today, including the Latin script used in English writing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn attempt to make this project more accessible, letters will be also transliterated into the Latin script (English letters) as well as the modern Hebrew script (as in the Torah) to allow the reader to get a sense of what the letters sound like.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Verse\n\n𐤁𐤓𐤀𐤔𐤉𐤕 𐤁𐤓𐤀 𐤀𐤋𐤄𐤉𐤌 𐤀𐤕 𐤄𐤔𐤌𐤉𐤌 𐤅𐤀𐤕 𐤄𐤀𐤓𐤑\n\n\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\n\nGenesis 1:1\n\n\n\nOpening a Torah today, you will be presented with modern Hebrew script:\n\nבראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ\n\nUsing only the Latin script that English speakers are familiar with this might read something like the following:\n\nBRASYT BRA ALHYM AT HSMYM VAT HARZ\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReminder: Vowels are not written. The written ‘A’ is not a vowel."
